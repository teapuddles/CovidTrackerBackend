## Covid-19 Tracker

Covid-19 Tracker is a web application created by Radouane 'Red' Bahi, and Kevin Gleeson. Due to Covid-19 information varying so widely all over the world, this app was created to be a central hub for commonly asked global/country specific statistics. Yeah, it isn't the most creative name.
